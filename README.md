Skin diseases are widespread and often require timely diagnosis, which can be challenging in under-resourced areas. This project presents a deep learning–based system for automated skin disease detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Dermatological images were preprocessed using augmentation and normalization techniques to improve model performance. The trained model accurately classified conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, and acne. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI to support early diagnosis, reduce diagnostic time, and enhance access to dermatological care, especially in teledermatology applications.
