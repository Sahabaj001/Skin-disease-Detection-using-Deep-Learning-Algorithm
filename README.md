Skin diseases affect a significant portion of the global population and,
if not diagnosed accurately and promptly, can lead to severe health
complications. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical
expertise, which may not always be readily available, especially in
remote or under-resourced areas. This project presents a deep
learning-based approach for automated skin disease detection using
image classification techniques.
The proposed system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to analyze and classify dermatological images into various categories
of skin diseases. A labeled dataset of skin condition images was used
to train and validate the model, employing preprocessing techniques
such as image augmentation and normalization to enhance
performance. The model achieved high accuracy in detecting
conditions like eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, and acne.
This deep learning solution demonstrates the potential to assist
dermatologists in early and accurate diagnosis, reduce diagnostic
time, and improve access to dermatological care. The project
underscores the effectiveness of AI-driven technologies in the
medical field and sets a foundation for future enhancements in
teledermatology applications.
